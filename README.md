<h1>👋 Hello!</h1>
This is a repo for algorithms that I think are worth sharing.


<h3>ℹ About</h3>

These algorithms are mainly from my time at Coding Dojo, Codewars.com, or somewhere completely random! 


<h4>📝 Please Note</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Algo instructions may look different based on where they came from.</li>
 <li>If there is a "_" in the file name it has two algorithms in it</li>
 <li>These algorithms are from the beginning to right now of my coding experience so difficulty may vary and mayhaps lack pseudo code (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻</li>
</ul>
